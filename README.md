# FordFulkerson
An implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. 

# Outline of the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
INPUTS: 
-a graph G (which is just a set of nodes, V, and edges, E)
-G must contain source and sink nodes
-all edges must be weighted

OUTPUT:
-returns f(), which is a function that tells us the amount
 of "flow" that is pumped through each edge in a max flow
